<h1>Hello... </h1><pre>
 Hello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S.
 as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut.
 Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col.
 David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette.
 The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.
